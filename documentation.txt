This allows users to receive movie recommendations based on their recently watched films. It uses the OMDb API to fetch movie details such as title, genre, plot, and year. The recommendations suggest movies with similar genres and themes but from different time periods. The system also enables users to log movies they’ve watched, storing the details in a database.

It is built using agents from the Swarm framework

Movie Recommendation Agent:

This suggests movies to users based on the movies they have recently watched. It finds movies with similar genres, themes, and time periods (within a range of 40 years). This agent fetches movie data using the OMDb API and provides recommendations by searching for movies that share the same genre and plot but are from different years.

recommend_movies(user_movies): Loops through the user's recently watched movies and fetches their details (genre, plot, year). It then calls the find_similar_movies function to get recommendations based on the fetched data.
find_similar_movies(genre, plot, year): Uses the OMDb API to search for movies that share the same genre and are within a specific year range (40 years before and after the user's watched movie year). It returns a list of similar movies.

Movie Logging Agent:

This allows users to log the movies they’ve watched by providing the IMDb ID. It fetches the movie details from the OMDb API and stores them in a database.
log_movie_agent_function(user_id, imdb_id): This function logs the watched movie by calling the log_watched_movie function. It stores the movie's title, genre, and year in the database for later retrieval.

Triage Agent:

The Triage Agent is responsible for directing the user to the appropriate agent based on their request. It ensures that the user's request for either movie recommendations or logging a movie is routed to the corresponding agent.
